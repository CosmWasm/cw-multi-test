# Security Policy

This repository is maintained by Confio as part of the CosmWasm stack.

The code here is not intended to be used in production, i.e. **cw-multi-test** should only be used as a [Development dependency].
Thus, it is not covered by the Cosmos bug bounty program and is not treated as strict as other components when it comes to bugs.
However, if you still think you found a security critical issue please find the contact information at [Advisories].
