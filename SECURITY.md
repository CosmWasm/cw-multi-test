# Security Policy

This repository is maintained by Confio as part of the CosmWasm stack.

The code here is not intended to be used in production
(i.e. cw-multi-test should only be used as a [Development dependency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#development-dependencies)).
Thus it is not covered by the Cosmos bug bounty program and is not treated as strict
as other components when it comes to bugs.
However, if you still think you found a security critical
issue please find the contact information at
https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/SECURITY.md.
