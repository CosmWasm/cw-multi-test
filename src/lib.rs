//! # CosmWasm MultiTest
//!
//! **CosmWasm MultiTest** is designed to simulate a blockchain environment in pure Rust.
//! This allows to run unit tests that involve **contract ðŸ¡˜ contract**,
//! and **contract ðŸ¡˜ module** interactions. **CosmWasm MultiTest** is not intended
//! to be a full blockchain application, but to simulate the Cosmos SDK x/wasm module close enough
//! to gain confidence in multi-contract deployments, before testing them on a live blockchain.
//!
//! The following sections explains some of the design for those who want to use the API,
//! as well as those who want to take a look under the hood of **CosmWasm MultiTest**.
//!
//! ## Key APIs
//!
//! ### App
//!
//! The main entry point to the system is called [App], which represents a blockchain application.
//! It maintains an idea of block height and time, which can be updated to simulate multiple
//! blocks. You can use application's [update_block](App::update_block) method to increment
//! the timestamp by 5 seconds and the height by 1 (simulating a new block) or you can write
//! any other mutator of [BlockInfo](cosmwasm_std::BlockInfo) to advance more.
//!
//! [App] exposes an entry point [execute](App::execute) that allows to execute
//! any [CosmosMsg](cosmwasm_std::CosmosMsg) and wraps it in an atomic transaction.
//! That is, only if [execute](App::execute) returns a success, then the state will be committed.
//! It returns the data and a list of [Event](cosmwasm_std::Event)s on successful execution
//! or an **`Err(String)`** on error. There are some helper methods tied to the [Executor] trait
//! that create the [CosmosMsg](cosmwasm_std::CosmosMsg) for you to provide a less verbose API.
//! [App]'s methods like [instantiate_contract](App::instantiate_contract),
//! [execute_contract](App::execute_contract), and [send_tokens](App::send_tokens) are exposed
//! for your convenience in writing tests.
//! Each method executes one [CosmosMsg](cosmwasm_std::CosmosMsg) atomically, as if it was submitted by a user.
//! You can also use [execute_multi](App::execute_multi) if you wish to execute multiple messages together
//! that revert the state as a whole in case of any failure.
//!
//! The other key entry point to [App] is the [Querier](cosmwasm_std::Querier) interface that it implements.
//! In particular, you can use [wrap](App::wrap) to get a [QuerierWrapper](cosmwasm_std::QuerierWrapper),
//! which provides all kinds of interesting APIs to query the blockchain, like
//! [query_all_balances](cosmwasm_std::QuerierWrapper::query_all_balances) and
//! [query_wasm_smart](cosmwasm_std::QuerierWrapper::query_wasm_smart).
//! Putting this all together, you have one [Storage](cosmwasm_std::Storage) wrapped into an application,
//! where you can execute contracts and bank, query them easily, and update the current
//! [BlockInfo](cosmwasm_std::BlockInfo), in an API that is not very verbose or cumbersome.
//! Under the hood it will process all messages returned from contracts, move _bank_ tokens
//! and call into other contracts.
//!
//! You can easily create an [App] for use in your testcode like shown below.
//! Having a single utility function for creating and configuring the [App] is the common
//! pattern while testing contracts with **CosmWasm MultiTest**.
//!
//! ```
//! use cw_multi_test::App;
//!
//! fn mock_app() -> App {
//!   App::default()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The [App] maintains the root [Storage](cosmwasm_std::Storage), and the [BlockInfo](cosmwasm_std::BlockInfo)
//! for the current block. It also contains a [Router] (discussed below), which can process
//! any [CosmosMsg](cosmwasm_std::CosmosMsg) variant by passing it to the proper keeper.
//!
//! > **Note**: [App] properly handles submessages and reply blocks.
//!
//! > **Note**: While the API currently supports custom messages, we don't currently have an implementation
//! > of the default keeper, except of experimental [CachingCustomHandler](custom_handler::CachingCustomHandler).
//!
//! ### Contracts
//!
//! Before you can call contracts, you must **instantiate** them. And to instantiate them, you need a `code_id`.
//! In `wasmd`, this `code_id` points to some stored Wasm code that is then run. In multitest, we use it to
//! point to a `Box<dyn Contract>` that should be run. That is, you need to implement the [Contract] trait
//! and then add the contract to the [App] via [store_code](App::store_code) function.
//!
//! The [Contract] trait defines the major entry points to any CosmWasm contract:
//! [instantiate](Contract::instantiate), [execute](Contract::execute), [query](Contract::query),
//! [sudo](Contract::sudo), [reply](Contract::reply) (for submessages) and [migrate](Contract::migrate).
//!
//! In order to easily implement [Contract] from some existing contract code, we use the [ContractWrapper] struct,
//! which takes some function pointers and combines them. You can take a look at **test_helpers** module
//! for some examples or how to do so (and useful mocks for some test cases).
//! Here is an example of wrapping a CosmWasm contract into a [Contract] trait to be added to an [App]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use cosmwasm_std::Empty;
//! use cw1_whitelist::contract::{execute, instantiate, query};
//! use cw_multi_test::{App, Contract, ContractWrapper};
//!
//! pub fn contract_whitelist() -> Box<dyn Contract<Empty>> {
//!     Box::new(ContractWrapper::new(execute, instantiate, query))
//! }
//!
//! let mut app = App::default();
//! let code_id = app.store_code(contract_whitelist());
//! // use this code_id to instantiate a contract
//! ```
//!
//! ### Modules
//!
//! There is only one root [Storage](cosmwasm_std::Storage), stored inside [App].
//! This is wrapped into a transaction, and then passed down to other functions to work with.
//! The code that modifies the Storage is divided into _modules_ much like the CosmosSDK.
//! Currently, the message processing logic is divided into one _module_ for every [CosmosMsg](cosmwasm_std) variant.
//! [Bank] handles [BankMsg](cosmwasm_std::BankMsg) and [BankQuery](cosmwasm_std::BankQuery),
//! [Wasm] handles [WasmMsg](cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg) and [WasmQuery](cosmwasm_std::WasmQuery), etc.
//!
//! ### Router
//!
//! The [Router] groups all modules in the system into one "macro-module" that can handle
//! any [CosmosMsg](cosmwasm_std::CosmosMsg). While [Bank] handles [BankMsg](cosmwasm_std::BankMsg),
//! and [Wasm] handles [WasmMsg](cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg), we need to combine them into a larger composite
//! to let them process messages from [App]. This is the whole concept of the [Router].
//! If you take a look at the [execute](Router::execute) method, you will see it is quite straightforward.
//!
//! Note that the only way one module can call or query another module is by dispatching messages via the [Router].
//! This allows us to implement an independent [Wasm] in a way that it can process [SubMsg](cosmwasm_std::SubMsg)
//! that call into [Bank]. You can see an example of that in _send_ method of the [WasmKeeper],
//! where it moves bank tokens from one account to another.
//!
