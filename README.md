**Testing tools for multi-contract interactions**

## Introduction

**CosmWasm MultiTest** is a suite of testing tools designed for facilitating multi-contract
interactions within the [CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm) ecosystem.
Its primary focus is on providing developers with a robust framework for simulating
complex contract interactions and bank operations.

## Library Capabilities

**CosmWasm MultiTest** enables comprehensive unit testing, including scenarios where contracts
call other contracts and interact with several modules like bank and staking. Its current implementation
effectively handles these interactions, providing a realistic testing environment for contract developers.
The team is committed to extending **CosmWasm MultiTest**'s capabilities, making it a versatile tool
for various blockchain interaction tests.

## Feature flags

**CosmWasm MultiTest** library provides several feature flags that can be enabled like shown below:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = { version = "2.1.0", features = ["staking", "stargate", "cosmwasm_2_0"] }
```

Since version 2.1.0, **CosmWasm MultiTest** has no default features enabled.
